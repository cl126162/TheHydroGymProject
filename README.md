# m-AIA meets HydroGym

[![HydroGym Environment Suite](assets/figure2_GitHub.svg)](https://github.com/cl126162/TheHydroGymProject)


A high-performance lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) solver backend for the HydroGym reinforcement learning platform, providing GPU-accelerated computational fluid dynamics environments for flow control research.

## Overview

This repository contains the m-AIA implementation of HydroGym environments, enabling large-scale 2D and 3D flow simulations for training reinforcement learning agents on active flow control tasks. The solver leverages lattice Boltzmann methods with adaptive mesh refinement and supports both CPU and GPU execution through MPI and hardware-agnostic parallelization.

## Key Features

- **42+ Flow Control Environments**: Circular/square cylinders, fluidic pinball, cavity flows, NACA airfoils, stenotic pipes, cubes, spheres.
- **Reynolds Number Range**: Re = 100 to 50,000 across different configurations.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Hardware-agnostic implementation supporting NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
- **Scalable Parallelization**: MPI-based domain decomposition with proven HPC scaling.
- **Standard RL Interface**: OpenAI Gym-compatible API for seamless integration with RL frameworks.
- **Multiple Actuation Strategies**: Synthetic jets, surface rotation, temperature control.
- **Flexible Sensing**: User-configurable point probes for velocity, pressure, and body forces.

## Quick Start

### Basic Environment Usage

```python
env_config = {
    "configuration_file": config_file,
    "is_testing": False,
    "render": False,
    # set customized probes values
    "probe_locations": probe_locations,
    }

# available environments
envs = {
        'cylinder': maiaGym.Cylinder,
        'rotary_cylinder': maiaGym.RotaryCylinder,
        'pinball': maiaGym.Pinball,
        'jet_pinball': maiaGym.JetPinball,
        'naca0012': maiaGym.NACA0012,
        'cavity': maiaGym.Cavity,
        'cavity3Jet': maiaGym.Cavity3Jet,
        'square_cylinder': maiaGym.SquareCylinder,
        'cube': maiaGym.Cube,
        'sphere': maiaGym.Sphere,
        }

# initialize cylinder environment
env = envs[maiaGym.Cylinder](env_config=env_config)

# reset environment
env.reset()

for i in range(100):
    obs, reward, done, _, _ = env.step(action=np.random.uniform(-env.MAX_CONTROL, env.MAX_CONTROL, size=env.num_inputs))
    
    if done or i % args.resetInterval == 0:
        print('Reset environment',flush=True)
        env.reset()

# close environment
env.maiaInterface.finishRun()
```
